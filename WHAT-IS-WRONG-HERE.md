# Exercises: what is wrong here?

Lots of things are done wrong (or very wrong ðŸ˜œ) in this repo. Your task is to find them and suggest improvements.

The areas you might be interested in are:
- type-safety, e.g. `!` (not-null assertions)
- project structure/modularity (e.g. what could fit into directory which is called `shared`?)
